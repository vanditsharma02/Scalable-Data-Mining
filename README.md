# Scalable-Data-Mining
The Solution for Scalable Data Mining Assignments (CS60021) Autumn 2020 at IIT Kharagpur. This repository is organized as follows-

- A1 - Used Spark and Scala to perform big data processing and answer queries on the provided dataset.
- A2 - Analyzed the accuracies of frequent count streaming algorithms such as Misra-Gries, Space Saving, and Count-min sketch on various generated streams w.r.t. respective distribution entropy. 
- A3 - Implemented different gradient descent optimisation methods such as Mini-Batch, Adam, etc. discussed in class as part of the lecture series on Large Scale Machine Learning.
