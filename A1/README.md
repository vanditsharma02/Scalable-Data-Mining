# Information-Retrieval
The Solution for Information Retrieval Assignments (CS60092) Autumn 2020 at IIT Kharagpur. This repository is organized as follows-

- A1 - Implemented Boolean Retrieval System to answer wild card queries using the schemes discussed in the class. 
- A2 - Implemented Ranked Retrieval System to answer free text queries using the schemes discussed in the class. 
- A3 - Implemented a Text Classification System using Naive Bayes, Rocchio, and KNN Algorithms. 

Also analyzed the impact of different optimization techniques such as feature selection, champion lists, cluster pruning, etc. on the performance of implemented systems.
